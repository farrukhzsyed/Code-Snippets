Carry out the following steps in order to complete this recipe:

1. In the AOT, create a new job named SendCustReminderEmail with the following 
code snippet (replace the customer account number with your own):


static void SendCustReminderEmail(Args _args)
{
 CustTable custTable;
 Map mappings;
 custTable = custTable::find('US-027');
 mappings = new Map(Types::String, Types::String);
 mappings.insert('customer', custTable.name());
 mappings.insert('company', CompanyInfo::find().Name);
 mappings.insert('user', HcmWorker::find(
 DirPersonUser::current().worker()).name());

 SysINetMail::sendEMail(
 'Reminder',
 custTable.languageId(), 
 custTable.email(),
 mappings);
}


2. Run the job and a message similar to what is shown in the following screenshot will 
appear on the screen:


In this recipe, we prepare a number of key-value mappings that will be inserted into the e-mail 
template. Then, we use the sendEMail() method of the SysINetMail class to send an 
e-mail using Outlook. This method accepts the following arguments:
> The name of the template
> The customer's language code
> The customer's e-mail address
> The prepared mapping
Note that depending on the version of Outlook, the To... field may not be populated automatically 
with the customer's e-mail address. This is due to a MAPI compatibility issue.
